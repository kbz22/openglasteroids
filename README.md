# openglasteroids
A simple 3D game made using OpenGL and C++ I made as a project for a course.

## Dependencies
This project uses [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h), [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [assimp](https://assimp.org/). While the first few are attached with the source code (they are header only libraries or in case of glad were generated for the project) it is neccesary to get [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/Build.md) and [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and attach them to your project for the game to compile.

## Credit
All models and sprites were made by me. The textures for the spaceship and the asteroid were taken from [here](https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Metal032) and [here](https://polyhaven.com/a/ground_grey).
